### Pull requests only

-   DON'T push to the main branch directly.
-   Always use feature branches and let people discuss changes in pull requests. 
-   Pull requests should only be merged after all discussions have been concluded and at least 1 reviewer has given their approval.

### General Guidelines

-   Write tests for all changes 
-   100% code coverage
